# About Nina Doinjashvili

Nina Doinjashvili is a technical systems designer specializing in automated workflows and artificial intelligence. Her work focuses on removing friction from digital operations, allowing teams and founders to focus on decision-making rather than administration.

Based in Paris and working globally, she combines technical precision with a strong aesthetic sensibility. She does not view technology as an end in itself but as a tool for clarity and calmness.

Her background spans custom web development and process automation. She builds systems that are designed to be forgotten—running reliably in the background, handling complex tasks, and surfacing information only when necessary.

Nina works primarily with creative businesses, small teams, and founders who value efficiency and thoughtful design. Her approach is characterized by a refusal to over-engineer; she builds exactly what is needed, nothing more.
