# Project: Portfolio AI Assistant

**Role:** A digital concierge for Nina's personal website.

**Objective:** To allow visitors to query the portfolio naturally, finding information about services, skills, and contact details without searching through text.

**Design & Behavior:**
The assistant is designed to be helpful, concise, and professional. It does not pretend to be human but adopts a polite, efficient persona. It is strictly scoped to answer questions related to Nina's work; it deflects unrelated topics.

**Technical Implementation:**
*   **Interface:** A custom-built chat UI embedded in the React/HTML frontend.
*   **Orchestration:** n8n logic controls the flow.
*   **Knowledge Base:** The system uses a structured set of responses (Greeting, Services, Projects, Tech, Contact) and keyword matching to deliver instant, accurate answers.
*   **Privacy:** No user data is stored beyond the active session.

**Outcome:**
Enhances the user experience by providing immediate answers and demonstrating Nina's competence in building practical AI interfaces.
