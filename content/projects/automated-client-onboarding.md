# Project: Automated Client Onboarding

**Role:** A zero-friction entry point for new business.

**Problem:**
Client onboarding is often messy, involving back-and-forth emails, scattered documents, and manual data entry into project management tools.

**Solution:**
A self-serve portal that guides the client through the necessary steps while automating the backend setup.

**Technical Implementation:**
1.  **Trigger:** Client accepts a proposal.
2.  **Collection:** A dynamic form collects project details, assets, and preferences.
3.  **Action:**
    *   Generates a contract and sends it for e-signature.
    *   Creates a dedicated project folder in Google Drive.
    *   Sets up a project board in Trello/Asana with standard templates.
    *   Invites the client to a shared Slack channel.
4.  **Notification:** Sends a "Welcome Pack" email with all links and next steps.

**Outcome:**
Transforms the first impression from chaotic to professional. Eliminates hours of cohesive admin work per new client.
